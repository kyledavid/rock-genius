Start on the decent sidepull with your right hand with your left on the polished
and obvious pocket. Make a high step to the chipped rail with your right foot.
Grab a higher up rail with your right hand and match. Switch your feet
and reach for a jug to your left. Get your left foot in the starting pocket and
grab a crimpy rail with your right. High step again to the rail from before.
Crimp with your left in a large pocket and bump your left up to the top out jugs.
